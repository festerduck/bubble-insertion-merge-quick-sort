# Anayzing the Time-bound Operations for Algorithms and verifying their growth rates.

In this lab, four algorithms were coded to analyse their upper bounds

## Objectives

    1. Program the sorting algorithms (Bubble, Inserting, Merge and Quick) in C++.
    2. Calculating running time of these sorting algorithms in C++.
    3. Verifying the growth rates for the learned sorting algorithms.
